this is data that everyone would have access to, a few permissions withstanding

map-set would be the sets of maps you are using this campaign, this can include
battle maps, area maps, etc
map sets would be collections of maps with standard permissions that could be shared

campaign calendar is for tracking the campaign specific events

setting is the complete settting for a campaign, such as The Sword Coast, Star Wars, etc.
Settings may have their own maps with them as well as calendars, certain widgets will
allow for the combining of the two, ie for calendar. Settings will be able to be created
by DMs and edited as such, they include history, as well as sets of NPCs potentially
